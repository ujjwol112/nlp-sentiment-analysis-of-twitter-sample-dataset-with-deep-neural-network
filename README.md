## Dataset

The `nltk.corpus.twitter_samples` corpus in the NLTK library consists of three JSON files, each containing a collection of tweets:

1. **positive_tweets.json**: Contains 5000 positive sentiment tweets.
2. **negative_tweets.json**: Contains 5000 negative sentiment tweets.
3. **tweets.20150430-223406.json**: Contains 20000 tweets collected from the public Twitter stream, which are not pre-labeled with sentiments.

### Content of the Twitter Samples
